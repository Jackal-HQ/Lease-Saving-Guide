Lease Saving Plan
Lease Saving Plan is a car lease and insurance calculator that helps users make informed decisions about car leasing. It allows users to calculate monthly lease payments, estimate insurance costs, and track savings toward their down payment goals. The program supports both English and Spanish for broader accessibility.

📝 Inspiration
Car leasing can be complex, especially when trying to understand the total cost, including lease payments, insurance, and budgeting. I was inspired to create a tool that simplifies this process, allowing users to manage their car lease decisions with ease and confidence.

🚗 What It Does
Lease Calculator: Calculates monthly lease payments based on user inputs like car selection, down payment, and lease term.
Insurance Estimator: Estimates monthly insurance costs based on the user’s age, driving history, and location.
Savings Tracker: Helps users track their savings toward the down payment goal.
Multi-Language Support: The app supports both English and Spanish.
🔧 How I Built It
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
CustomTkinter for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
SQLite for database management to store and retrieve car data.
Matplotlib for visual representation of data (pie charts).
The program dynamically calculates lease payments and insurance based on user inputs, while also allowing the user to toggle between English and Spanish interfaces.

🚧 Challenges I Faced
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the dynamic calculations for lease payments and insurance worked seamlessly with user inputs. Another challenge was managing a smooth language toggle for all UI components, ensuring technical terms were translated appropriately.

🏆 Accomplishments
I’m proud of building a user-friendly, intuitive tool that simplifies the car leasing process for users of varying financial literacy levels. The successful implementation of a language toggle feature expanded the app’s accessibility, making it usable by a wider audience.

📚 What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned the importance of making financial tools simple to use, even when handling complex calculations. I also gained experience in integrating databases with dynamic UIs, and the significance of multi-language support in expanding user accessibility.

🔮 What’s Next
Credit-Based Interest Rates: Add the option to factor in the user’s credit score to determine interest rates.
Customizable Insurance Options: Allow users to customize their insurance plans with different coverage options.
Expanded Car Database: Add more car models to the database for a wider selection.
Enhanced Savings Tracker: Improve the savings tracker to include more detailed budgeting tools.
Additional Languages: Expand the language options beyond English and Spanish.
